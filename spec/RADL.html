    companies, and vital to the way users use information on the
    Web. Companies like eBay, Amazon, Salesforce, and Google provide
    valuable services via Web APIs, and developers are using these APIs
    together with other data sources to create new kinds of applications
    that run on a variety of devices and environments. Some analysts are
    now writing about the API Economy, and even people who have never
    programmed may know why Web APIs are important.</p><p>Web service providers may have little knowledge of the clients that
    use them, but they need to ensure that these clients can continue to
    run as they evolve their services. Web services may need to support
    large numbers of users, so they must be scalable. These means that Web
    API providers must design their APIs to support evolution and
    scalablility in distributed systems. This is not easy.</p><p>Fortunately, this is precisely the problem that REST
    (Representational State Transfer) was designed to
    solve. Unfortunately, designing and documenting RESTful APIs is still
    too much of a black art, causing many difficulties for the average
    developer. An XML vocabulary that supports the design process is
    extremely helpful for designing a RESTful API and for teaching RESTful
    API design, and is well suited to writing documentation.</p><p>Developers who write clients need documentation to know how to use Web
    APIs. Their programs may need a machine-readable representation of the
    API as runtime metadata. An XML vocabulary works well for this, and
    can easily be converted to JSON and HTML for developers who prefer
    this representation.</p><p>RESTful API Description Language (RADL) is an XML vocabulary
    created to support RESTful Web API design. It can be used to create
    both documentation and runtime metadata. The design of RADL is focused
    on the media type, in keeping with this famous quote by Roy
    Fielding <a class="xref" href="#hypertext-driven">REST APIs must be hypertext-driven</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Any effort spent describing what methods to use
    on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the
    scope of the processing rules for a media type.</p></blockquote></div><p>RADL provides much the same information as Web Application
    Description Language (WADL)

    <a href="#ftn.d5e42" class="footnote" name="d5e42"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>,

    but the structure of WADL is driven
    by URI patterns and server-side implementation concerns rather than
    hypermedia-driven design. RADL provides much the same information as
    RESTful Service Description Language (<a class="xref" href="#RSDL2">RESTful Service Description     Language (EMC)</a>), but the structure of
    RSDL is driven by resources, describing an implementation rather than
    focusing on the media-types.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e47"></a>REST</h2></div></div></div><p>REST Is an Architectural Style, which is formally defined by the
    following constraints:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Client/Server</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Stateless</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Cache</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Uniform interface</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Layered system</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Code-on-demand (optional)</p></li></ol></div><p>The client/server constraint demands that we divide our system
    in multiple components, since monolithic applications cannot be made
    to scale. Each component can be further divided as needed. For
    instance, the client can be a browser and the server a web
    application. We can then further divide the web application into a web
    server for the CPU-intensive processing and a database server for
    I/O-intensive processing. Distributing capabilities over multiple
    components gives us the opportunity to give each the resources it
    needs.</p><p>The layered system constraint additionally requires that the
    client cannot see beyond its immediate server. This allows us to
    change our server landscape without breaking the client. We could, for
    example, insert proxy servers to aid with scaling.</p><p>We can further improve scalability by moving some of the
    processing from the server to the client. The stateless constraint
    makes us move data to the client so that the server need not maintain
    application state. Here, we must distinguish two different kinds of
    state: the server will maintain resource state, so that interesting
    data is available from multiple clients, but the client is responsible
    for application state. The client knows what goal it wants to achieve
    and can easily remember where along the path to that goal it is.
    </p><p>The code-on-demand constraint additionally pushes processing to
    the client. We see this when web servers send JavaScript to the
    browser, which then executes it. This optional constraint is very
    common on the Web, but less common in RESTful APIs.</p><p>The cache constraint also helps with scalability. The server
    indicates how long data that it sends is valid, so that the client
    does not have to keep asking for it. If clients do so anyway, we can
    insert caching proxy servers to keep our servers available for useful
    work.</p><p>The uniform interface constraint is the one that really distinguishes
    REST from other approaches. Anybody who has played with Legos knows
    the power of a universal interface. In REST over HTTP, we capture all
    actions with the standard HTTP methods.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e69"></a>How we designed RADL</h2></div></div></div><p>We designed RADL by refactoring RSDL to define almost everything in
    terms of media types. In RSDL, we focused on describing services. In
    RADL, we focus on describing media types. This shift was motivated by
    the Roy Fielding quote cited in the introduction  <a class="xref" href="#hypertext-driven">REST APIs must be hypertext-driven</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Any effort spent describing what methods to use
    on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the
    scope of the processing rules for a media
    type.</p></blockquote></div><p>The structure of a REST API is based on media types,
    including the documents associated with a media type, links found
    in these documents, and the interfaces associated with these
    links.  This is also the structure of a RADL description. A
    client's current application state, including the choices
    available to the client, is found in documents that are described
    by a media type.  The client needs to understand the media type in
    order to identify available choices and make use of them. In <a class="xref" href="#hypertext-driven">REST APIs must be hypertext-driven</a>, Fielding explains how a client uses
    this kind of API:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A REST API should be entered with no prior
    knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of
    standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended
    audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might
    use the API). From that point on, all application state
    transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided
    choices that are present in the received representations or
    implied by the user&#8217;s manipulation of those representations. The
    transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client&#8217;s
    knowledge of media types and resource communication mechanisms,
    both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g.,
    code-on-demand). [Failure here implies that out-of-band
    information is driving interaction instead of
    hypertext.]</p></blockquote></div><p>These are the things that a client needs to know to use a
    REST API, so these are the things that RADL must describe.  To
    design RADL, we collecting the formal definitions of the entities
    we needed to model, identifying their relationships in the
    documents that define them, and faithfully preserving these
    relationships in our schema.  A RADL description is a description
    of a service, using the following definition <a href="#ftn.d5e80" class="footnote" name="d5e80"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A service is a set of interlinked resources that
    allows clients to reach goals by following links with explicit
    interaction semantics.</p></blockquote></div><p>Once a complete media type description is done, the resource
    description for a service is simple and small, associating URI formats
    with interfaces that are defined in the media type descriptions.</p><p>Fielding's thesis refers to (the now obsoleted) <a class="xref" href="#rfc2048">RFC 2048</a> for the definition of media type.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A media type is a precise and openly available specification of
    the data format of a representation.</p></blockquote></div><p>A media type defines how a sequence of bytes is to be interpreted as
    data. For instance, the JPEG specification defines how images of
    photographic quality are to be coded. A browser uses this knowledge to
    draw images on screen.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A media type is used to indicate the semantics
    of the bytes that make up the data.</p></blockquote></div><p>Not only does a media type define the layout of the data, it
    also defines the semantics, or how to process the data. For instance,
    the XML specification defines when a document is well-formed and valid
    and what whitespace is significant.</p><p>For services that we design, we usually want to present
    structured information, so the layout of the data is generally defined
    in terms of structured formats like XML or JSON. They can be generic,
    like XML, or more tailored to a specific field, like XACML
    (application/xacml+xml) for access control. They can even be specific
    to a single service, such as Documentum
    (<code class="code">application/vnd.emc.documentum+xml</code>). However, media
    types can also be unstructured, like JPEG
    (<code class="code">image/jpeg</code>). RADL needs to be able to support both
    structured and unstructured media types. A media type may define more
    than one kind of document. The Atom Syndication Format defines feed
    and entry documents, for example. A complex custom RESTful service
    might define many more kinds of documents.</p><p>The second job of a media type is to define semantics, or how to
    process the data. In REST, the client maintains application state and
    drives the interactions with the server, so the server can only guide
    it by exposing where the client can go next, providing a set of
    options in the form of hypermedia links. These links are typed via
    link relations that identify the relationship between the source and
    target resource. This is why the semantics of a service are defined
    primarily by the semantics of the hypermedia.</p><p>Since any RESTful API must limit its operations to the uniform
    interface, we need to do nothing more than decide which subset of the
    uniform interface to expose. In practice, this means we must select
    which of the standard HTTP methods to support, and define the
    conventions for those methods in the context of a given media
    type. These conventions include methods that can be applied to a URI
    that implements each interface, together with any URI parameters,
    headers, and request bodies used when making these requests.</p><p>A service description contains a few items that are needed to
    implement the service but are not needed by the client. Resource
    descriptions are the most common example. This kind of information
    generally should not be provided to clients, because developers may be
    tempted to write clients that depend on it, resulting in more tightly
    coupled systems. A service description can also contain items that are
    needed by both the client and the implementation, but are orthogonal
    to the media types. Authentication is the most common example. This
    information must be provided to the user, but not as part of the media
    type. RADL allows the entire service description to be specified in
    one document. The information needed for client documentation, server
    stub generation, runtime metadata, and testing can then be extracted
    from the complete description as needed.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e99"></a>The RADL document</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that we have defined the concepts behind RADL, let us show how
    they are modeled in a RADL document. The following template
    illustrates the overall structure of RADL (a RELAX-NG schema can be
    found in <a class="xref" href="#appendix-a" title="Appendix A: RADL Schema">the section called &#8220;Appendix A: RADL Schema&#8221;</a>):</p><pre class="programlisting">

main concepts we discussed in the previous section: link relations,
media-types, and resources. Media types contain documents that
describe the data format and interfaces that describe the semantics.</p><p>Now let us provide a concrete example, taken from chapter 5 of the
book RESTful Web Services. This chapter deals with the read-only
aspects of a service that provides information about places. The next
chapter then goes on to add mutability. Since that does not change
anything about the way we capture information in RADL, we will
confine ourselves to chapter 5 here in order to keep the example
short.</p><pre class="programlisting">

</pre><p>This starting fragment shows how we can add documentation to RADL. We
support different documentation modules. Our TechPubs department uses
DocBook, for instance, but in this paper we will only use HTML. To keep
the RADL document well-formed XML, we will use XHTML and we declare its
namespace. We can use all of HTML's elements and additionally we can
use the ref element to refer to things. We added ref so that we could
refer to RADL concepts, like link relations, and more easily process
those references. Working with only generic a elements would be
awkward.</p><pre class="programlisting">
  &lt;link-relations&gt;
    &lt;link-relation id="rel-place" name="place"&gt;
      &lt;documentation&gt;
        The target resource is a place related to the current resource.
      &lt;/documentation&gt;
    &lt;/link-relation&gt;
    &lt;link-relation id="rel-point" name="point"&gt;
      &lt;documentation&gt;
        The target resource is a point on a planet related to the current resource. 
      &lt;/documentation&gt;
    &lt;/link-relation&gt;
    &lt;link-relation id="rel-map" name="map"&gt;
      &lt;documentation&gt;
        The target resource is a map related to the current resource. 
      &lt;/documentation&gt;
    &lt;/link-relation&gt;
    &lt;link-relation id="rel-image" name="image"&gt;
      &lt;documentation&gt;
        The target resource is an image related to the current resource.
      &lt;/documentation&gt;
    &lt;/link-relation&gt;
  &lt;/link-relations&gt;
</pre><p>This example uses only link relations that were invented for this
service, but you could add more generic ones, like <code class="code">self</code> as well.</p><p>There is no defined model for naming link relations. All the generic
ones like self use simple names, and they are registered by IANA in a
flat namespace. However, to avoid name collisions, you may want to use
URIs for your own specialized link relations. EMC is moving towards
using URIs of the form <code class="code">http://identifiers.emc.com/linkrel/&lt;name&gt;</code>.</p><p>The next section defines the media types. The first media type used in
this service is PNG. It is used for displaying images of maps of
places. This media type defines only one kind of document and one
interface. Since this chapter of the book deals with a read-only
service, all you can do with the images is retrieve them through the
GET method.</p><pre class="programlisting">

</pre><p>The next media type is the one that is defined specifically for
this service. It is based on XHTML. The author could have defined its
own media type, say <code class="code">application/vnd.oreilly.maps+xml</code>, but
decided against that, and extends the
<code class="code">application/xhtml+xml</code> media type instead. The HTML part
of the media type makes it easy to consume the service with generic
clients like web browsers. The X part of the media type also makes it
possible to consume the service with a special-purpose client. For
those types of clients, it would probably have been easier to use a
new vocabulary, but then you would loose the browsers. Every service
has to weigh the pros and cons. In the services that EMC provides,
general purpose clients can provide very little value, so we create
new media types like <code class="code">application/vnd.emc.documentum+xml</code>
and build special purpose clients instead.</p><p>This media type defines several kinds of documents and
interfaces. It defines how to get from one document to another via
links that are typed using link relations. It also defines how these
documents can be processed using interfaces.</p><pre class="programlisting">

        meaning using the &lt;html:code&gt;class&lt;/html:code&gt; attribute to elements.
        For example, adding &lt;html:code&gt;class="planets"&lt;/html:code&gt; to the &lt;html:code&gt;ul&lt;/html:code&gt; element, we can

</pre><p>The final section of the RADL document contains the implementation
details: the resources. A resource lives at a URI or URI
Template <a class="xref" href="#rfc6570">URI Templates</a>. URI Templates define variables that sometimes are part of
the interface, but to keep things simple we do not show that in this
paper. Resources implement interfaces. In this example the
correspondence is 1:1, so that's not very interesting, but there are
cases where it makes sense to let a resource implement more than one
interface.</p><pre class="programlisting">
  &lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;resource id="res-planets" name="planets"&gt;
      &lt;location uri="/"/&gt;
      &lt;interface ref="int-planets"/&gt;
    &lt;/resource&gt;

    &lt;resource id="res-place" name="place"&gt;
      &lt;location uri-template="/{planet}/[{scoping-information}/][{place-name}]{?show}"/&gt;
      &lt;interface ref="int-place"/&gt;
